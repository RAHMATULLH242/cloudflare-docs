{{<heading-pill style="beta">}}Versions & Deployments{{</heading-pill>}}

Versions and deployments are used to track changes to your Worker and configure how those changes are deployed to your traffic.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Versions and deployments are in **beta and under active development**. Please read [limitations](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#limitations) before using these features.

Provide your feeback through this [feedback form](https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/developer-week-deployments).

## Versions
Versions track the state of code as well as the state of configuration defined in a scriptâ€™s [wrangler.toml](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) file. They track historical changes to [bundled code](/workers/wrangler/bundling/) and changes to configuration like [bindings](/workers/configuration/bindings/), [compatibility date and compatibility flags](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/) over time.

Metadata associated with a version is also tracked, including the version ID, user that created the version, deploy source, timestamp. Optionally, a version message and version tag can be configured on version upload. 

{{<Aside type="note">}}

State changes for associated Workers storage resources such as [KV](/kv/), [R2](/r2/), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/) and [D1](/d1/) are not tracked with versions.

## Deployments

Deployments track the version(s) of your Worker that are actively serving traffic. A deployment can consist of one or two versions of a Worker. 

By default, Workers supports an all-at-once deployment model where traffic is immediately shifted from one version to the newly deployed version automatically. Alternatively, [gradual deployments]((/gradual-deployments)) can be used to safely roll out a new version by incrementally shifting traffic it.

Metadata associated with a deployment is also tracked, including the user that created the deployment, deploy source, timestamp and the version(s) in the deployment. Optionally, a deployment message can be configured when a deployment is created. 

## Using Versions and Deployments

With versions and deployments, you can upload changes to your Worker independent of changing the version that's actively serving traffic. This is useful if:

- You're running critical applications on Workers and want to reduce risk when deploying new versions of your Worker.
- You want to monitor for performance differences when deploying new versions of your Worker.
- You have a CI pipeline configured for Workers, but want to cut manual releases.

### New versions are created one of two ways

**Uploading a new version and deploying it immediately**

Changes uploaded with `npx wrangler deploy`, via the Cloudflare dashboard or the [Workers Script Upload API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/worker-script-upload-worker-module) create a new version that is automatically deployed to 100% of traffic. 

**Uploading a new version to be [gradually deployed](/gradual-deployments) or deployed at a later time** 

In order to create a new version that is not deployed immediately, use the new wrangler command `npx wrangler versions upload --experimental-gradual-rollouts` or create a new version via the Cloudflare dashboarding using the "Save changes" buttons.

For more details on the wrangler commands, refer to the [`versions` documentation](/workers/wrangler/commands/#versions). 

{{<Aside type="note">}}

**New versions are not created when you make changes to [resources connected to your Worker](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/)**

For example, if two Workers (Worker A and Worker B) are connected via a [service binding](/workers/configuration/bindings/about-service-bindings/), changing the code of Worker B will not create a new version of Worker A. It will only create a new version of Worker B. Changes to the service binding (such as, deleting the binding or updating the [environment](/workers/wrangler/environments/) it points to) on Worker A will also not create a new version of Worker B.

## Viewing versions and deployments

### Via Wrangler

Wrangler allows you to view the 10 most recent versions and deployments. Refer to the [`versions`](/workers/wrangler/commands#versions) and [`deployments`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deployments) documentation to view the commands. 

### Via the Cloudflare dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers) and select your account.
2. Select your Worker > **Deployments**.  

## Limitations

**Making changes to Routes, Custom Domains, Cron Triggers, Logpush or Tail Workers**

As of now, wrangler users must deploy updates to [Routes](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/), [Custom Domains](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), [Cron Triggers](/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/), [Logpush](/observability/logging/logpush/) or [Tail Workers](observability/logging/tail-workers/) using `npx wrangler deploy`. Updates to this configuration using `npx wrangler versions upload --experimental-gradual-rollouts` will not take effect. This will be fixed in the near future.
